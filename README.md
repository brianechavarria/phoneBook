# phoneBook
Requires a "phonebook credentials.txt" document to function properly This project is a python phonebook desktop application using postgresql to locally store the desired information. I don't think postgresql was the most elegant solution for this use case; however, I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to learn how to work with sql within python.

Once you have a "phonebook credentials.txt" document with your postgresql username in the first line and password in the second, you run the db_create.py file followed by the phoneBook.py file to initialize the application.
